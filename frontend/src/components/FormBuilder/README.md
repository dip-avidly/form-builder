# Form Builder Layout Updates

The form builder has been updated to use a modern horizontal layout with the following improvements:

1. Horizontal Three-Panel Layout
   - Left sidebar for tools and components
   - Main content area in the center
   - Properties panel on the right

2. Visual Improvements
   - Consistent padding and spacing
   - Card-like containers with subtle shadows
   - Smooth scrolling areas
   - Modern border radius and hover effects
   - Responsive design considerations

3. Style Organization
   - Modular SCSS files
   - Consistent use of variables
   - Improved visual hierarchy

The layout now uses modern flexbox properties instead of the Bootstrap grid system for better control and maintainability.
